# JupyterNotebooks
Converted previous Data Science projects from personal, volunteer or studies to work in Jupyter Notebooks. 
Upon converting some of these I have noticed that the graphs that were usable in RStudio are not suitable for Jupyter Notebooks. However, this would just require some changes to the ggplot code but not changing so that the code remains the same, just that it is now working in Jupyter Notebooks. 

All work has been part of personal project, study or volunteer.
